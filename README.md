# Dreame lawn mower integration for Home Assistant

Testing features added to @bhuebschen version.

First working alpha version of the dreame-mower integration.

Please not that this is a modified version of Tasshack's "Dreame Vacuum" integration to work with the lawn mower, in this state it may causes a lot of error-messages.

If you are interested in the (original) Vacuum-integration, please take a look at: https://github.com/Tasshack/dreame-vacuum

#### I would be very pleased if others would also contribute to getting this integration fully functional ðŸ‘€

If you like it: leave me a star!
